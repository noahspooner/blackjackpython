# blackjackpython
blackjackpython is a simple Blackjack game written in Python that you can play on the command line. 

Discalimers: 

This game of Blackjack contains no money and no gambling in any way, shape, or form. 
If you do not like this, you can play another Blackjack game that does include gambling, or you can fork this repository and add the gambling software yourself.

You must have Python 3 to run this.

This project is still in development and might not work.


How to play:

To play, you need to simply download the zip folder by pressing the green code button on the project's main page and then press 'Download ZIP'. Once this is done, you can unzip the folder on your computer.
After this, open a terminal (or PowerShell if you're a Windows user) and cd into the directory.
Once you've done this, you must enter 'python3 main.py' (but remove the quotes) if you are using a Unix machine (mainly macOS, Linux, and Android) or enter 'python main.py' (once again, remove the quotes) if you are on Windows.
After this, the program will tell you what to do, and you are good to go.
